Countries' income levels are based on  June 2018 GNI per capita from World Bank. But since GNI are not available for all countries or areas, their sum does not add up to the world's total.

Population estimates are not available for some small countries. Consequently, aggregates may not add up.

B := Estimates derived from foreign-born populations
C := Estimates derived from data or foreign citizens
R := Number of refugees or people in refugee-like situations
I := Estimates were just imputed, as no data on international migrants were available for said regions.

% TopoJSON's countries availability will determine which countries make the cut. %

Table 1 : Migrant hot-spots from 1990 - 2019. Tailored for static idioms. Can be filtered for males, females or total, on:
    - Individual countries
    - Aggregated geographic regions (i.e., continents)
    - (Un)development groups
    - World Bank income groups.

#
# Better to visualize the data with:
#     - Heatmaps superposed on the network
#     - Per-country time-series with barcharts below the timeline

===========================================================================================

Table 1 --> visualized with area chart



Table2 --> total population -->
same visualizations as table1, static



Table3 --> same as Table2, useful to visualize the percentage of
migrants arrived in a country with respect to the total
populatio



Table 4 --> as a Table2, useful to visualize the percentage of
females with respect to the total number of migrants



Table 5 --> annual rate of change of the migrant stock, may be plotted
by modifying (with a button, on the left with respect
to the map) the x-axis of the same idiom used for
Table 2, 3, 4



Table 6 --> same visualization as before (2, 3, 4),
but for refugees, which are
a subset of the total number of migrants. The table
includes also the rate of change, as in Table 5.



Visualizations: area chart with years on the
x-axis, migrant stocks on
the y-axis, with the possibility of selecting
one or more countries to which migrants have moved
We may also include the possibility of comparing
the time series' or the bar charts of two different
countries at the same time



In the end, we keep table 1, 2, 3, 6. We may decide to include also
the rate of change in the same area chart used to visualize the
aforementioned tables. In that case, the rate of change may be
inserted in the idiom as a simple number.
