## Map page

- Ensure pan-and-zoom actions do not cut information out of the dynamic map

- Implement filters logic
- Clarify magnitude filter functionality
- Implement Top 5 inward/outward carousel
- Add a 'How to read' section in the bottom-left blank space
- Implement vertical bar to control current visualization 

## World page

- Create the mapping from TopoJSON's countries short name to our full name in the CVS files.
- Insert the countries data into the TopoJSON properties

- Barchart in the bottom-left corner with a single metric across the timespan (1995-2019):
    + Each bar will represent the average of that metric for a given year across all world countries
    + Selecting a bar should restrict the information to the corresponding year only,
        change the top label to show the correct year-metric pair, and update the choropleth map accordingly

- A color legend should be precomputed for each metric, conveying the minimum and the maximum possible value
    in the outer rect ticks in order to keep the colors consistent on data changes

- Top 5 and Flop 5 countries for the selected metric should have their flags displayed
    in the bottom right corner with appropriate labels

- Hovering over a country should highlight its outline on the map and fill the bottom center section
    with its name, its individual metric and other relevant info. Otherwise, just show a placeholder.

- Clicking onto a country, either on the map or on its flag, should navigate to its Country page

- Fill the blank space atop the barchart with info on the current metric:
    + What it stands for
    + How it has been calculated

## Country page

-- Add descriptive labels to flags, idioms and country

- Clearly separate inward from outward idioms
    + Inward idioms:
        * Annual rate of change line chart;
        * Immigration by age groups stacked barchart.

    + Outward idioms:
        * Migratory patterns pie charts.

## Compare page

-- Mutual migration information between the two countries
-- No timespan (that is, full 1990-2019 range)
-- Keep gender information female/male/all
-- Stacked barchart with common/most frequent migration regions/countries
-- Line chart with mutual annual rates of change
-- Suitable idioms with migratory patterns comparison

- Highlight the central block with green/red colors on whose the better country
- Add relevant timespan (1995-2019) label in the center of the page
- Push selectors to the sides closer to country flags

- Textual snippets for specific age ranges nearby country flags:
    + Enfants, 0-4;
    + Students and early workers, 19-34;
    + Mature adulthood, 35+.

- Clearly indicate the inward/outward nature of the plots at the bottom:
    + Inward idioms:
        * Annual rate of change line chart;

    + Outward idioms:
        * Migratory regions side-by-side barchart.

## FIXMEs

- Collapsing timespan when closing nav menu in Map page
